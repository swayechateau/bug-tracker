How it works
------------

Flatdoc is a hosted `.js` file (along with a theme and its assets) that you can
add into any page hosted anywhere.

#### All client-side

There are no build scripts or 3rd-party services involved. Everything is done in
the browser. Worried about performance? Oh, It's pretty fast.

Flatdoc utilizes the [GitHub API] to fetch your project's Readme files. You may
also configure it to fetch any arbitrary URL via AJAX.

#### Lightning-fast parsing

Next, it uses [marked], an extremely fast Markdown parser that has support for
GitHub flavored Markdown.

Flatdoc then simply renders *menu* and *content* DOM elements to your HTML
document. Flatdoc also comes with a default theme to style your page for you, or
you may opt to create your own styles.

Markdown extras
---------------

Flatdoc offers a few harmless, unobtrusive extras that come in handy in building
documentation sites.

#### Code highlighting

You can use Markdown code fences to make syntax-highlighted text. Simply
surround your text with three backticks. This works in GitHub as well.
See [GitHub Syntax Highlighting][fences] for more info.

    ``` html
    <strong>Hola, mundo</strong>
    ```

#### Blockquotes

Blockquotes show up as side figures. This is useful for providing side
information or non-code examples.

> Blockquotes are blocks that begin with `>`.

#### Smart quotes

Single quotes, double quotes, and double-hyphens are automatically replaced to
their typographically-accurate equivalent. This, of course, does not apply to
`<code>` and `<pre>` blocks to leave code alone.

> "From a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. That is the
> point that must be reached."  
> --Franz Kafka

#### Buttons

If your link text has a `>` at the end (for instance: `Continue >`), they show
up as buttons.

Customizing
===========

Basic
-----

### Theme options

For the default theme (*theme-white*), You can set theme options by adding
classes to the `<body>` element. The available options are:

#### big-h3
Makes 3rd-level headings bigger.

``` html
<body class='big-h3'>
```

#### no-literate
Disables "literate" mode, where code appears on the right and content text
appear on the left.

``` html
<body class='no-literate'>
```

#### large-brief
Makes the opening paragraph large.

``` html
<body class='large-brief'>
```

### Adding more markup

You have full control over the HTML file, just add markup wherever you see fit.
As long as you leave `role='project-tracker-content'` and `role='project-tracker-menu'` empty as
they are, you'll be fine.

Here are some ideas to get you started.

 * Add a CSS file to make your own CSS adjustments.
 * Add a 'Tweet' button on top.
 * Add Google Analytics.
 * Use CSS to style the IDs in menus (`#acknowledgements + p`).

### JavaScript hooks

Flatdoc emits the events `project-tracker:loading` and `project-tracker:ready` to help you make
custom behavior when the document loads.

``` js
$(document).on('project-tracker:ready', function() {
  // I don't like this section to appear
  $("#acknowledgements").remove();
});
```

Full customization
------------------

You don't have to be restricted to the given theme. Flatdoc is just really one
`.js` file that expects 2 HTML elements (for *menu* and *content*). Start with
the blank template and customize as you see fit.

Misc

Inspirations
------------

The following projects have inspired Flatdoc.

 * [Backbone.js] - Jeremy's projects have always adopted this "one page
 documentation" approach which I really love.

 * [Docco] - Jeremy's Docco introduced me to the world of literate programming,
 and side-by-side documentation in general.

 * [Stripe] - Flatdoc took inspiration on the look of their API documentation.

 * [DocumentUp] - This service has the same idea but does a hosted readme 
 parsing approach.
